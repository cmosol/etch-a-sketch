# etch-a-sketch
This is a cross between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch. The project was built using html, css, and javascript. During the development process I learned extensively about event listening and dynamic DOM manipulation. Furthermore, I experiemented with state management when implementing the mode selection. Check out this projects current progress here: https://cmosol.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

# Instructions 
The app features a black and white mode which draws on the grid in black, a color mode that draws in a randomly generated RGB color, an eraser to selectively clear squares on the grid, and a clear button which will clear the entire grid. Simply choose a color mode and drag the mouse over the grid to draw. Enjoy!

# To-do List:
- Make resolution editable through prompt
- Depress ui buttons when selected
- easter egg
